    <h1>Wel come to the git tutorial</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a command line tool that will help us with version control in
      several different ways: Allowing us to keep track of changes we make to
      our code by saving snapshots of our code at a given point in time.
      Allowing us to easily synchronize code between different people working on
      the same project by allowing multiple people to pull information from and
      push information to a repository stored on the web. Allowing us to make
      changes to and test out code on a different branch without altering our
      main code base, and then merging the two together. Allowing us to revert
      back to earlier versions of our code if we realize we’ve made a mistake.
      In the above explanations, we used the word repository, which we haven’t
      explained yet. A Git repository is a file location where we’ll store all
      of the files related to a given project. These can either be remote
      (stored online) or local (stored on your computer).

    <h1>Merge Conflit</h1>
    <p>
      Merge Conflicts One problem that can emerge when working with Git,
      especially when you’re collaborating with other people, is something
      called a merge conflict. A merge conflict occurs when two people attempt
      to change a file in ways that conflict with each other. This will
      typically occur when you either git push or git pull. When this happens,
      Git will automatically change the file into a format that clearly outlines
      what the conflict is. Here’s an example where the same line was added in
      two different ways: a = 1 <<<<< HEAD b = 2 ===== b = 3 >>>>>
      56782736387980937883 c = 3 d = 4 e = 5 In the above example, you added the
      line b = 2 and another person wrote b = 3, and now we must choose one of
      those to keep. The long number is a hash that represents the commit that
      is conflicting with your edits. Many text editors will also provide
      highlighting and simple options such as “accept current” or “accept
      incoming” that save you the time of deleting the added lines above.
      Another potentially useful git command is git log, which gives you a
      history of all of your commits on that repository.
