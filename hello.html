    <h1>Wel come to the git tutorial</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a command line tool that will help us with version control in
      several different ways: Allowing us to keep track of changes we make to
      our code by saving snapshots of our code at a given point in time.
      Allowing us to easily synchronize code between different people working on
      the same project by allowing multiple people to pull information from and
      push information to a repository stored on the web. Allowing us to make
      changes to and test out code on a different branch without altering our
      main code base, and then merging the two together. Allowing us to revert
      back to earlier versions of our code if we realize we’ve made a mistake.
      In the above explanations, we used the word repository, which we haven’t
      explained yet. A Git repository is a file location where we’ll store all
      of the files related to a given project. These can either be remote
      (stored online) or local (stored on your computer).
